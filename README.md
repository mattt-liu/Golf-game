# Geo Golf

## About
This is a game I made in my high school Senior year Introduction to Computer Science class as my final project. The game features 20 unique levels and with varying degrees of diffculty, and a custom physics engine coded from the ground up.

## Design
I used [JavaX.Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html) and [Java.AWT](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/package-summary.html) for my graphics and user interface. This game features many hard coded physics calculations I implemented through my own rudimentary physics engine. Some interactions and collisions are still rusty and there are many bugs such as corners and moving levels.
