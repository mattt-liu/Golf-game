# Geo Golf

# this is a game i made my in grade 12 intro to comp sci class as my
# final project. i received a mark of 100 on this project and all 
# code is 100% original

# i used javax swing and awt for my graphics and this game
# was heavily math based calculations in my code. it's still rusty and 
# there are many bugs. corners are buggy and moving levels are
# unpredictable. 

# i have multiple custom classes such as Ball.java or Line.java and a
# staticly referenced class call Calculations.java. Calculations is a
# class that handles all the calculations in my program and
# collisions. All the other custom classes are objects in my game
# have their own methods. My main method is inside Golf.java so
# you'll want to run that file if u want to play it

# please feel free to borrow chunks of my code and reference it and
# contact me if u have any questions.
